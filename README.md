### Hi! I'm Vladimir Agafonkin.

I'm a **software engineer**. I created [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com), the number one library for interactive web maps, and maintain [50+ other](https://github.com/mourner/projects) open source projects with a focus on algorithms, computational geometry and performance. I'm building the future of maps at [Mapbox](https://mapbox.com). Here are a few of my best tech articles: https://agafonkin.com

I'm a **musician**. I write songs, play guitar and sing in [Obiymy Doschu](https://rain.in.ua/en). If you like beautiful, evocative, multilayered rock music with string arrangements, check out our [last album](https://rain.in.ua/son/en).

I'm a **father** to beautiful 6-year-old twin girls, I'm happily married and live in Kyiv, Ukraine. I love photography, strength training, martial arts, baking, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7379374-vladimir) sci-fi and fantasy, and exploring quiet parks. You can find tidbits of my life on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mournerv/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mourner) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/agafonkin).
